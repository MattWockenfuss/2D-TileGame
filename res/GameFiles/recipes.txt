//To add a crafting recipe, copy paste one of the previous recipes and put your own data as follows
//you can put letters A-I which each one has an itemID and and Item Count
//
//      Letter:ItemID,itemAmount
//Ex.   A:1,1		which is 1 amount of id 1, which is stick
//
//      the product tag has a similar input, however, if your stackAmount is greater than the itemID's max stack size that you put in, then the amount is set to the max stack size
//														reading that sounds way more  confusing that it actually is 
//														Ex.  product:4,999	---->   product:4,64
//														
//														if you put in an id that doesn't exist for the product, it becomes a bass for obvious reasons
//														if you put in an ID that doesn't exist for one of the ingredients(the A-I stuff) than the ingredient is tossed from the recipe
//															(As in the recipe no longer requires that item)
//														if you put in a stack size bigger than the max stack size for one of the ingredients, fuck you you cant make it then dumb bitch
//
//
//
//			BTW: white space and only lines starting with "//" are ignored, you can't add comments to the end of lines
//
//
//
//			Feel completely able bodied to add as many recipes as you want, if they are logical and dont completely brake the game i will probably add them
//
//			


//Recipes you probably shouldn't get rid of
